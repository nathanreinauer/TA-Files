        <p>This is the <b>final practical</b> 
            part of the Visual Studio course. Basically, I need to
            create an HTML file called "index.html" and fill it with
            content. This is that content.
        </p>
        <p>Hey! Here's a link 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_door">
                to the Wikipedia page for screen doors
            </a>. Isn't that somethin'?
