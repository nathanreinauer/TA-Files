DRILL:

Fix the following:
1. Light-blue background color is not displaying.
2. The Heading is not displaying.
3. There are typos in the Title.
4. The bold isn't displaying for "I am a bold student of The Tech Academy."
5. The link to The Tech Academy's website is broken (not working).
6. The image is squished (too thin).
7. "Have you seen The Tech Academy's Student Orientation video?" is not centered.
8. The embedded Youtube video isn't displaying.

Here is the code you have to work with:
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>This is the title.</title>
	</head>
	
	<body style="background-color: #a8d1ff; color: #005682;">
		<h1>This is the Heading.</h1>

		<p>I have a Title and a Heading.</p>

		<p><b>I am a bold student of The Tech Academy.</b></p>
